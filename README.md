## [GTEx: Genotype-Tissue Expression](https://gtexportal.org/home/)

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study **tissue-specific gene expression and regulation**. Samples were collected from **54 non-diseased tissue sites** across **nearly 1000 individuals**, primarily for molecular assays including **WGS**, **WES**, and **RNA-Seq**. Remaining samples are available from the GTEx Biobank. The GTEx Portal provides open access to data including gene expression, QTLs, and histology images.
